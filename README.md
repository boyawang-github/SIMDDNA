# SIMD||DNA sequences

The code for artificially designed sequences can be found at:
- "counter_seq_gen.nb": generates the sequence space
- "counter_4bit_sequence_assignment.nb": assign sequences for the binary counting program
- "Rule110_useCounterSeq.nb": assign sequences for the Rule 110 program

The code for M13 sequences can be found at "M13sequence.nb".
